To launch the program, simply run "julia -t [the number of threads on your CPU] fractals.jl".

Navigate with WASD, zoom with I and O, reset view with H, quit with Q, to render an image, hit R (the exported resolution is twice what you input plus one pixel)

If you want better preview resolution, just decrease font size in your terminal (usually CTRL -).
