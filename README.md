To launch the program, simply execute it with Julia, with the -t flag set to the amount of threads your machine has.

Navigate with WASD, zoom with I and O, reset view with H, quit with Q, to render an image, hit R (the exported resolution is twice what you input plus one pixel)

If you want better preview resolution, just decrease font size in your terminal (usually CTRL -).
